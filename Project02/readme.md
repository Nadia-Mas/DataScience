# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis – CS 5163 Project 2

Welcome to the Weather Data Analysis project! This project is part of the **CS 5163: Data Science** course at UTSA, Spring 2025, under the instruction of **Dr. Mohammad Imran Chowdhury**. The goal is to explore historical weather trends using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## 📚 Project Description

In this project, we explore maximum and minimum temperature patterns across two U.S. cities:

- **Minneapolis, MN** – known for its cool climate
- **San Diego, CA** – known for its warm, coastal weather

Using `.dly` weather files and custom Python functions, we perform:

1. **Data extraction** and inspection.
2. **TMAX analysis** in Minneapolis (1940–2014).
3. **TMIN analysis** in San Diego (1940–2014).
4. Identification of years with **extreme average temperatures**.
5. Combined plotting of temperature ranges using `fill_between()`.

## 🧪 Tasks

### ✅ Task 1:
- Load `weather.zip` dataset into a Jupyter Notebook.
- List and inspect files.

### ✅ Task 2:
- Analyze **TMAX in Minneapolis** (mean per year from 1940–2014).
- Identify the **warmest year**.
- Plot the daily temperature for that year.

### ✅ Task 3:
- Analyze **TMIN in San Diego** (mean per year from 1940–2014).
- Identify the **coldest year**.
- Plot the daily temperature for that year.

### ✅ Task 4:
- Plot **both TMAX and TMIN** for:
  - The warmest year in Minneapolis
  - The coldest year in San Diego
- Use `fill_between()` for a smooth visual comparison.
